### A collection of resources for data driven advertisers

## Motivation :crystal_ball:

There was a time when advertising was in it's infancy and creatives were able to make decisions and produce successful campaigns relying on their gut. You could come up with a cool idea, sell it to the client, win some awards and rake in the dolla. Let's call this the golden era.

Things have changed since then. Advertising exploded and it's everywhere. Consumers have adapted and become better at blocking shitty advertising out. Clients have also evolved, they're less concerned about awards and more concerned about making actual money. No longer can we hide behind vanity metrics like awards and funny TV commercials.

Now more than ever advertisers need to be smart, we need to use every tool available to understand & connect with our consumers.

With the advent of the digital age our most powerful tool is data and never before has so much been freely available.

### Mission

Our goal is to educate the collective by pulling together resources to ensure the next generation of advertising is better for everyone.
